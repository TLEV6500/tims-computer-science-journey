## Prompt

"Hey, I'm trying to build a model of regression analysis in code. Can you give me a guide on what functionalities I need to implement to make my program complete? You do not have to give me examples, descriptions of the functions would be fine."

## Response

Here’s a structured guide to the **core functionalities** you’ll need to implement for a complete regression analysis program, categorized by workflow:

---

### **1. Data Preparation**

- **Data Loading**:  
  Function to read datasets (e.g., CSV, Excel) into a structured format (e.g., arrays/dataframes).
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  Handle missing values (imputation/removal), outliers, and duplicates.
- **Feature Selection/Engineering**:  
  Identify relevant features and create new ones (e.g., polynomial terms, interactions).
- **Normalization/Scaling**:  
  Standardize features (e.g., Z-score, Min-Max) for gradient-based methods.

---

### **2. Model Setup**

- **Design Matrix Construction**:  
  Build the matrix \( X \) (features) and vector \( y \) (target), including an intercept term.
- **Parameter Initialization**:  
  Initialize coefficients (e.g., zeros, random values) for iterative methods.

---

### **3. Core Regression Algorithms**

Implement at least one of these:

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**:  
  Solve \( \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \) for linear regression.
- **Gradient Descent**:  
  Optimize coefficients iteratively using a cost function (e.g., MSE).
- **Regularization (Optional)**:  
  Add L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) penalties to the cost function.

---

### **4. Model Evaluation**

- **Cost Function Calculation**:  
  Compute metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or MAE.
- **Cross-Validation**:  
  Split data into training/validation sets to assess generalization.
- **Residual Analysis**:  
  Plot residuals to check for patterns (heteroscedasticity, non-linearity).

---

### **5. Visualization (Optional but Recommended)**

- **Scatter Plots**:  
  Show actual vs. predicted values.
- **Coefficient Plots**:  
  Visualize feature importance (for linear models).
- **Learning Curves**:  
  Plot training/validation error vs. dataset size.

---

### **6. Prediction & Deployment**

- **Prediction Function**:  
  Given new \( X \), output predictions \( \hat{y} = X\beta \).
- **Model Persistence**:  
  Save/load trained models (e.g., serialization with Pickle/JSON).

---

### **7. Extras (Advanced)**

- **Multicollinearity Check**:  
  Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
  Optimize learning rate (gradient descent) or regularization strength.
- **Support for Non-Linear Models**:  
  Extend to polynomial/logistic regression if needed.

---

### **Key Considerations**

- **Assumptions**:  
  Verify linearity, independence, and normality (for OLS).
- **Efficiency**:  
  Use vectorized operations (e.g., NumPy) for large datasets.

This modular approach ensures flexibility (e.g., swapping OLS for gradient descent) and scalability. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any section!
